Three of the ski hikers had fatal injuries: Thibeaux-Brignolles[16] had major skull damage, and both Dubinina and Zolotaryov had major chest fractures.

Notably, the bodies had no external wounds associated with the bone fractures, as if they had been subjected to a high level of pressure. All four bodies found at the bottom of the creek in a running stream of water had soft tissue damage to their head and face.
