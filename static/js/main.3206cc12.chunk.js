Three of the ski hikers had fatal injuries: Thibeaux-Brignolles[16] had major skull damage, and both Dubinina and Zolotaryov had major chest fractures. According to Dr. Boris Vozrozhdenny, the force required to cause such damage would have been extremely high, comparable to the force of a car crash. Notably, the bodies had no external wounds associated with the bone fractures, as if they had been subjected to a high level of pressure. All four bodies found at the bottom of the creek in a running stream of water had soft tissue damage to their head and face. For example, Lyudmila Dubinina was missing her tongue, eyes, part of the lips, as well as facial tissue and a fragment of skullbone,[18] while Semyon Zolotaryov had his eye balls missing, Aleksander Kolevatov his eye-brows.
