    text: "Before leaving, Dyatlov had agreed he would send a telegram to their sports club as soon as the group returned to Vizhai. It was expected that this would happen no later than 12 February, but Dyatlov had told Yudin, before his departure from the group, that he expected to be longer. When the 12th passed and no messages had been received, there was no immediate reaction, as delays of a few days were common with such expeditions. On 20 February, the relatives of the travellers demanded a rescue operation and the head of the institute sent the first rescue groups, consisting of volunteer students and teachers. Later, the army and militsiya forces became involved, with planes and helicopters being ordered to join the rescue operation.",

    text: "A legal inquest started immediately after the first five bodies were found. A medical examination found no injuries that might have led to their deaths, and it was eventually concluded that they had all died of hypothermia. Slobodin had a small crack in his skull, but it was not thought to be a fatal wound. An examination of the four bodies which were found in May shifted the narrative as to what had occurred during the incident. Three of the ski hikers had fatal injuries: Thibeaux-Brignolles[16] had major skull damage, and both Dubinina and Zolotaryov had major chest fractures. According to Dr. Boris Vozrozhdenny, the force required to cause such damage would have been extremely high, comparable to the force of a car crash. Notably, the bodies had no external wounds associated with the bone fractures, as if they had been subjected to a high level of pressure. All four bodies found at the bottom of the creek in a running stream of water had soft tissue damage to their head and face. For example, Lyudmila Dubinina was missing her tongue, eyes, part of the lips, as well as facial tissue and a fragment of skullbone,[18] while Semyon Zolotaryov had his eye balls missing, Aleksander Kolevatov his eye-brows. V. A. Vozrozhdenny (the forensic expert performing the autopsy) judged that these injuries happened post-mortem due to the location of the bodies in a stream.",

    text: "Journalists reporting on the available parts of the inquest files claim that it states:Six of the group members died of hypothermia and three of fatal injuries.There were no indications of other people nearby on Kholat Syakhl apart from the nine travellers. The tent had been ripped open from within. The victims had died 6 to 8 hours after their last meal.Traces from the camp showed that all group members left the campsite of their own accord, on foot. High levels of radiation were found on only one victim's clothing.To dispel the theory of an attack by the indigenous Mansi people, Vozrozhdenny stated that the fatal injuries of the three bodies could not have been caused by another human being, 'because the force of the blows had been too strong and no soft tissue had been damaged'. Released documents contained no information about the condition of the skiers' internal organs.There were no survivors of the incident.",
